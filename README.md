In this task, I worked on the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
The goal was to:
	â€¢	Clean the dataset by handling missing values and irrelevant columns.
	â€¢	Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand relationships between variables.
	â€¢	Identify meaningful patterns and insights about survival chances on the Titanic.

â¸»

ðŸ“Œ Approach / Steps Followed
	1.	Load the Dataset
	â€¢	Used pandas to load the train and test datasets into Google Colab.
	â€¢	Checked dataset shape, columns, and missing values.
	2.	Data Cleaning
	â€¢	Filled missing Age values with the median.
	â€¢	Filled missing Embarked values with the most common port (mode).
	â€¢	Dropped the Cabin column (too many missing values).
	â€¢	Filled missing Fare in the test dataset with median.
	3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	â€¢	Survival Counts: Bar chart showing total survivors vs non-survivors.
	â€¢	Survival by Gender: Compared male vs female survival rates.
	â€¢	Age Distribution: Histogram showing age ranges of passengers.
	â€¢	Fare vs Pclass: Boxplot to visualize how ticket prices varied by passenger class.
	â€¢	Correlation Heatmap: Checked how numerical variables (Age, Fare, Pclass, SibSp, Parch) relate to survival.
	4.	Insights Found
	â€¢	Women had a higher survival rate compared to men.
	â€¢	First-class passengers survived more often than second or third class.
	â€¢	Younger passengers (especially children) had higher chances of survival.
	â€¢	Higher ticket fares were associated with better survival chances.

 ðŸ“Œ How to Run the Project/Code
	1.	Open Google Colab.
	2.	Upload train.csv and test.csv files (Titanic dataset).
	3.	Install required libraries if not already available:

    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns

  4.	Run the cleaning and visualization code (already explained in steps).
	5.	Outputs (plots/graphs) will be displayed inline in Colab.
